## 📑 Report Content
The key topics to be addressed are as follows:

**🚀 Kotlin Basics:**
  In this unit, we will delve into the fundamentals of Kotlin, exploring essential concepts of object-oriented programming and lambdas. This knowledge will provide the necessary foundation for interactive application development.

**⚙️ Add a Button to an App:**
  In this section, we will learn to incorporate interactivity into our Android applications. We will explore how to add a button and respond to click events in an app. This will allow for greater dynamism in the user-app interaction.

**⚙️ Interact with User Interface and State:**
  We will continue building on your previous Kotlin skills, taking you beyond the basics. We will dive into creating a tip calculator application, where you will learn to handle the user interface and manage the application state to enhance the user experience. Let's create together!

This learning path provides greater proficiency in interface development in **Android** applications.

## 🎮 Running the Application
Additionally, to compile and run your Android application locally, follow these steps using Android Studio:

1. Open your project in Android Studio.

2. Ensure that all dependencies are correctly configured.

3. Click on the "Build" button to compile your application.

4. Once the compilation is complete, select an emulator or connect a physical device.

5. Click on the "Run" button to execute the application on the emulator or device.

Please note that these steps assume that you have already configured your development environment correctly and that your application is error-free. Enjoy compiling and running your application in Android Studio!


## 📄 Report Compilation
If you wish to compile the report in Overleaf instead of doing it on your local machine, you can follow these steps:

1. Open your project in Overleaf (make sure you have created an account on Overleaf and imported your project there).

2. Locate the "codelab.tex" file in the project on Overleaf.

3. Click on the "codelab.tex" file to open it in the Overleaf editor.

4. At the top of the editor, you will see a button called "Recompile" or "Compile" (it may vary depending on the version of Overleaf). Click on this button.

5. Overleaf will automatically compile the LaTeX document and generate the corresponding PDF file.

6. Once the compilation is complete, you can download the resulting PDF file from the Overleaf interface.
